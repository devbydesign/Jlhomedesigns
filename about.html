                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p>Formerly known as JL Home Designs, our family business founded by Jared Lesser, who spent more more than 20 years creating smart, well-loved house plans for families who wanted custom homes without custom-home prices. His work earned industry recognition and was featured in the Parade of Homes. After Jared’s passing in 2022, his sister, Alicia Stephens, continued the business with a clear focus: affordable, thoughtful design that truly works for real families.
Today, JL Custom Home Plans is intentionally small. You work directly with Alicia from start to finish—no sales staff, no handoffs, and no unnecessary overhead. This keeps costs down and communication clear. Once your custom plan is complete, we collaborate with trusted engineers to ensure your plans are build-ready and meet all structural requirements.
This streamlined approach allows us to offer personalized service, faster decisions, and excellent value for families and builders who care about both quality and cost.</p>

                <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                <p><strong>We believe custom home design should be accessible—not intimidating or overpriced. A well-designed home doesn’t have to be extravagant to be beautiful, functional, and comfortable.</strong>
Our focus is on smart layouts, efficient use of space, and features that add everyday value—like extra storage, practical mudrooms, flexible living areas, and kitchens designed for real life. We help you prioritize what matters most so your budget is spent where it counts.
Because we work one-on-one, you stay closely involved in the process. You’ll understand your options, see how design choices affect cost, and have the freedom to adjust details along the way. We offer transparent pricing at just $1 per square foot, so you can plan confidently without surprises.</p>

                <h3>How We Work With You</h3>
                <p>JL Home Designs is a great fit for budget-conscious custom builders and families who want control, clarity, and value.
When you choose us, you work directly with the designer responsible for your home—not a rotating team. This means:
<ul>
<li>Fewer misunderstandings and quicker answers</li>
<li>Greater control over layout, features, and cost decisions</li>
<li>A collaborative process that respects your budget</li>
<li>A plan designed to be efficient to build, not just nice to look at</li>
</ul>
We guide you through each step—from initial ideas to final blueprints—with honesty and practical advice. Our goal is to help you build a home you love, one that fits your family and your finances.
At JL Home Designs, small by design means personal service, lower costs, and plans made with real-life building in mind.</p>
