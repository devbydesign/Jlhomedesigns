            <p>I showcase a <strong>small selection of sample home plans online</strong> to give you an idea of my design style and capabilities. These examples represent only a portion of my full collection.</p>

              <p>My complete plan book includes a wide range of designs, including <strong>ramblers, two-story homes, ramblers with attic living space, and custom garages.</strong> If you don’t see exactly what you’re looking for online, feel free to reach out. If you share the style you’re interested in and your approximate square footage, I can send additional plan samples that better fit your needs.</p>
